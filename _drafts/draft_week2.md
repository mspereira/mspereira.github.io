Week 2! I've been working on my blog, improving it, and correcting some of the bugs. I got introduced to git-flow which is a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model (More about Vincent Driessen's model [Here][Link_branchmodel]).Then i started doing the CoderDojo website, first i made a research about other coderdojos in the world. After that i started doing a wireframe in Balsamiq,(balsamiq is a is a rapid wireframing tool that helps you Work Faster & Smarter. It reproduces the experience of sketching on a whiteboard, but using a computer.) That wireframe had some inspiration on the websites i've searched before.After doing that i had to present the mockup to a couple of people here to see if it was good. After it was approved i started to do the website prototype with Semantic/UI , semantic-ui is development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.I faced some problems with some bugs , but they are all corrected by now.
