Week 2! Iv'e been working on my blog, improving it, and correcting some of the bugs. I got introduced to git-flow which is a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model(More about Vincent Driessen's model [Here][Link_branchmodel]).Then i starteed doing the CoderDojo website, first i made a research about other coderdojos in the world. After that i started doing a wireframe in Balsamiq,(balsamiq is a is a rapid wireframing tool that helps you Work Faster & Smarter. It reproduces the experience of sketching on a whiteboard, but using a computer.) That wireframe had some inspiration on the websites iv'e searched before.
