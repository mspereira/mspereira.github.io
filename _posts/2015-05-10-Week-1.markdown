The 1st week of internship on “Nuno Veloso, Lda” was astonishing I learnt a lot of new stuff, like Trello, Jekyll , I started to use Linux (Ubuntu). Let me start with Trello, Trello is a awesome project management tool that makes collaboration easy , you can read about trello [here][Trello_link2] and [here][Trello_link1] here. 

Another thing I learnt was jekyl, whats jekyl ? You may ask, jekyll is a powerful blog-aware, static site generator,  that is quite easy to use (until now).Configuring jekyll was kinda hard in the beginning because of my platform, which was windows,  Windows led me to a huge time consuming problem, that was compatibility, jekyll doesn't like windows very much, so I decided to migrate to Linux more specifically Ubuntu (About [Ubuntu][Ubuntu]) so I can work more freely with jekyll, and it worked flawlessly !Then I proceeded to start configuring my blog and publish it on GitHub Pages, which is the one you're reading from right now.
