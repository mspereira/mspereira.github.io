The 1st week of internship on “Nuno Veloso, Lda” was astonishing i learnt a lot of new stuff, like Trello, Jekyll ,and i started to use Linux (Ubuntu). Let me start with Trello, Trello is a awesome project management tool that makes collaboration easy , you can read about trello basics [here][Trello_link2] and about agile trello workflow [here][Trello_link1].

Another thing i learnt was jekyl, whats jekyll ? You may ask, jekyll is a powerful blog-aware, static site generator,  that is quite easy to use (until now).Configuring jekyll was kinda hard in the beginning because of my platform, which was windows,  Windows led me to a huge time consuming problem, that was compatibility, jekyll doesn't like windows very much, so I decided to migrate to Linux more specifically Ubuntu (You can read more about ubuntu [here][Ubuntu]) so I can work more freely with jekyll, and it worked flawlessly !Then I proceeded to start configuring my blog and publish it on GitHub Pages, which is the one you're reading from right now.

OH! and Git, almost forgot Git, which is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows, and GitHub has the source code of git but its a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration.So far my git experiece has been great,i used it before but it was the graphical appearance of Github, i never used the Git on the terminal and in the begining it has kindda complicated but with practice i will get there.
